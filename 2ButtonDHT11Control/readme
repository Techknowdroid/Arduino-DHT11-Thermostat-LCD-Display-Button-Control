This DHT11lcdTESTnewPROGRAM2buttonREMOTE2.ino sketch has the added functionality of being able to use an infra red Remote control,
(in this case the DENON RC-981 remote), to be able to control the thermostat's cutoff temperature by raising it or reducing it by
pressing certain keys on the remote.

The AirCON compressor can be force started also, by pressing a certain key on the remote.

To get the values for the (infra red) Denon RC-981 Remote controller or any other TV's infra red remote control,
you can use the IRremote Ken Shirriff Library from https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote
